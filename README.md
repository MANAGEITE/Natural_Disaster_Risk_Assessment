4 Infrastructure data: roads, bridges, buildings, etc.
5 Historical data on natural disasters.
# 2. Data Preparation:
1  Clean and preprocess the data to make it compatible with the GIS system.
2 Convert the data into the required format for spatial analysis.
# 3. Vulnerability Analysis:
1 Identify potential vulnerability factors for each type of natural disaster (floods, earthquakes, wildfires).
2 Use spatial analysis methods to assess the impact of these factors on the vulnerability of the area.
